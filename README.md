# PCOS Risk Analyzer Application

This project is a Python-based PCOS Risk Analyzer that evaluates the risk level
(Low / Medium / High) based on user-provided health-related inputs.

The application is developed for academic and learning purposes to understand
logic building, conditional analysis, and basic application flow.

## Features
- Takes multiple health-related inputs from the user
- Analyzes data using rule-based conditions
- Categorizes PCOS risk as Low, Medium, or High
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (if used)

## How It Works
The application evaluates user inputs using predefined conditions and assigns
a risk category based on cumulative risk factors.

## Disclaimer
This application is not a medical diagnostic tool and is intended only for
educational and awareness purposes.
